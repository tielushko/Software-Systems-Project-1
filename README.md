# Software-Systems-Project1

* The project created using windows forms. 
* In Part 1 I am showing the distribution of the roll of dice based on user's roll count and seed.
* In Part 2, I display the sum of 2 dice based on user's rollcount and seed.

Just build the solution and run the application. Input the amount of rolls you would like to be displayed of the 6-sided die. In addition, enter the seed for random number generator.
